## **METHODS**

### **Study Design and Setting**

We conducted a prospective multicenter cohort study to develop and validate a clinical risk score for predicting 30-day mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Uganda. The study was designed to address three primary research questions: (1) identification of clinical predictors of 30-day mortality in CAP patients, (2) assessment of HIV status as a mortality predictor in the modern antiretroviral therapy era, and (3) development of a practical bedside risk stratification tool for resource-limited settings.

The study was conducted at three major public tertiary referral hospitals in Uganda: Mulago National Referral Hospital (the country's largest teaching hospital), Kirrudu National Referral Hospital (a major referral center serving Kampala and surrounding districts), and Naguru General Hospital (a regional hospital in Kampala). These hospitals serve diverse populations from across Uganda, with primary coverage of the Central region, and provide care in a high HIV prevalence setting where antiretroviral therapy has been widely available since the mid-2000s.

Uganda's healthcare system context is representative of many sub-Saharan African countries, with limited intensive care resources, variable access to laboratory testing, and significant burden of both infectious and non-communicable diseases. The study hospitals operate within this resource-constrained environment while serving as major referral centers for pneumonia care. All three facilities have established protocols for pneumonia management following national guidelines, with HIV testing and care integration being standard practice.

The study protocol was developed following STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for observational research. Ethics approval was obtained from [INSERT SPECIFIC IRB/ETHICS COMMITTEE DETAILS]. All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment, with consent procedures conducted in English or local languages as appropriate. Data collection procedures included robust privacy protections and participant de-identification protocols.

The prospective design was chosen to ensure systematic data collection and minimize selection bias, while the multicenter approach enhanced the generalizability of findings across different hospital settings and patient populations. The 30-day follow-up period was selected as the primary endpoint based on established pneumonia research standards and its clinical relevance for acute mortality risk assessment. This timeframe captures deaths directly attributable to the pneumonia episode while remaining feasible for complete follow-up in the study setting.

### **Participants**

**Inclusion Criteria**  
We enrolled consecutive adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to the study hospitals with a clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. CAP diagnosis was based on the presence of acute respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea, or pleuritic chest pain) accompanied by clinical signs of pulmonary consolidation (abnormal lung examination findings) and/or radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates, with symptom onset in the community setting. Patients were required to be admitted for inpatient care and willing and able to provide informed consent.

**Exclusion Criteria**  
We excluded patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (defined as symptom onset >48 hours after hospital admission), patients with severe immunocompromise other than HIV infection (including those receiving chemotherapy, immunosuppressive medications, or with organ transplantation), patients with incomplete baseline data for core clinical predictors, and those lost to follow-up within the 30-day observation period. Patients admitted directly to intensive care units were included if they met other eligibility criteria and consent could be obtained.

**Sample Size Calculation**  
The target sample size was calculated based on expected 30-day mortality rates of approximately 15% for CAP in sub-Saharan African settings, derived from regional literature and pilot data from the study hospitals. For mortality prediction model development, we aimed for a minimum of 10 events per candidate predictor variable, following established epidemiological guidelines for logistic regression modeling. Based on an expected mortality rate of 15% and plans to evaluate approximately 15 candidate predictors, we calculated a minimum required sample size of 300 participants. To account for potential loss to follow-up and missing data, we targeted enrollment of 350-400 participants to ensure adequate power for multivariable modeling and risk score development.

**Recruitment Process**  
Enrollment utilized consecutive sampling of eligible patients during the study period to minimize selection bias. Research staff maintained daily presence at study hospitals during weekday and weekend periods to identify potential participants through review of admission logs and clinical consultations. Standardized screening procedures were implemented across all sites, with regular training and quality assurance monitoring to ensure consistent application of inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The final study population comprised 365 enrolled participants, with 354 (97.0%) having complete data for the primary analysis. This excellent retention rate was achieved through comprehensive follow-up procedures and minimal missing data in key clinical variables. The geographic distribution reflected the hospitals' catchment areas, with the majority of participants (94.0%) residing in Uganda's Central region, consistent with the study hospitals' service areas and referral patterns.

### **Data Collection**

**Baseline Data Collection**  
Comprehensive baseline data were collected for all participants within 24 hours of hospital admission using standardized case report forms implemented through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) electronic data capture systems. Trained research staff conducted structured interviews and clinical assessments following standardized protocols developed specifically for this study.

Demographic information included age, sex, and detailed residence information (district, village/subcounty, and regional classification). Medical history assessment covered known comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis history, and HIV status. Behavioral risk factors included standardized assessment of smoking history (defined as ≥100 cigarettes during lifetime) and alcohol consumption patterns over the preceding 12 months. Clinical presentation data captured symptom duration, severity indicators, and functional status using a standardized 5-point clinical severity scale.

**Physical Examination and Clinical Assessment**  
Standardized physical examinations were performed by trained clinical staff, with vital signs measured using calibrated equipment following established protocols. Temperature was measured using digital thermometers, blood pressure using manual sphygmomanometers or automated devices, and oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry. Heart rate and respiratory rate were counted manually over full 60-second periods to ensure accuracy. Anthropometric measurements included height (measured to nearest centimeter using stadiometers) and weight (measured to nearest kilogram using calibrated scales), with body mass index calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.

Clinical severity assessment utilized both objective and subjective measures, including the standardized functional status scale and clinical judgment regarding overall severity of presentation. Healthcare providers completed standardized assessment forms documenting their clinical impressions and management decisions.

**Laboratory Testing and HIV Assessment**  
HIV testing followed Uganda's national testing algorithm, utilizing rapid diagnostic tests with confirmatory testing as appropriate. For participants with unknown HIV status, counseling and testing were offered following national guidelines. Existing HIV diagnosis was verified through review of medical records and HIV care documentation where available. Other laboratory testing was performed as clinically indicated according to standard care protocols, rather than as study-mandated procedures.

**Data Quality Assurance**  
Comprehensive data quality procedures included standardized training for all data collectors, regular inter-rater reliability assessments, and systematic data validation checks. REDCap systems included built-in range checks and consistency validations to minimize data entry errors. Regular data audits were conducted by study supervisors, with feedback provided to data collection teams.

A critical data quality issue was identified during analysis involving extreme BMI values (>2000 kg/m²) due to height measurement data entry errors. Systematic review identified two participants with height entries of 15 cm and 81 cm, which should have been recorded as 150 cm and 181 cm respectively. These corrections were implemented following established data correction protocols, with all changes documented and verified. Post-correction BMI values were clinically plausible and substantially improved data quality metrics.

**Follow-up Procedures**  
Thirty-day follow-up was conducted through multiple complementary approaches to maximize completeness. In-hospital outcomes were tracked through daily review of hospital records and clinical consultations. For participants discharged before 30 days, follow-up included structured telephone interviews with participants or family members, review of readmission records at study hospitals, and verification of vital status through available registry systems.

Follow-up staff utilized standardized protocols for outcome ascertainment, with systematic documentation of all contacts and outcome verification procedures. The 97.0% complete follow-up rate achieved reflects the comprehensive nature of these procedures and the commitment to minimizing missing outcome data.

### **Variable Definitions**

**Primary Outcome**  
The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality, defined as death from any cause occurring within 30 days of the index hospital admission date. This endpoint was chosen based on established pneumonia research standards and its clinical relevance for assessing acute mortality risk. Time zero was defined as the date and time of hospital admission, with the 30-day period calculated precisely to avoid misclassification.

Mortality ascertainment utilized multiple complementary sources including hospital records for in-hospital deaths, family contact for post-discharge deaths, and review of available death registries. All deaths were verified through at least two independent sources when possible, with systematic documentation of cause of death information where available.

**Secondary Outcomes**  
Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality (death during the index hospitalization regardless of timing), 30-day rehospitalization (unplanned readmission to any hospital within 30 days), and a composite poor outcome (death OR rehospitalization within 30 days). Length of hospital stay was calculated as days from admission to discharge or death.

**Predictor Variables**  
Candidate predictor variables were selected based on clinical importance, established literature, and practical feasibility for bedside assessment. Continuous variables included age (years), vital signs (temperature in degrees Celsius, heart rate in beats per minute, respiratory rate in breaths per minute, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in mmHg, oxygen saturation as percentage), and body mass index (kg/m²).

Clinical threshold variables were created based on established literature and clinical guidelines. Age ≥65 years represented the threshold for elderly classification, though modified for our younger population. Vital sign thresholds included systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg (indicating hypotension), respiratory rate ≥30 breaths per minute (indicating tachypnea), oxygen saturation <90% (indicating severe hypoxemia), and heart rate >100 beats per minute (indicating tachycardia). BMI <18.5 kg/m² was used to define underweight status following WHO criteria.

Comorbidity variables included HIV-positive status (determined through testing or documented diagnosis), diabetes mellitus (documented diagnosis or treatment), and tuberculosis history (previous TB treatment or diagnosis). Clinical severity was assessed both as a continuous functional status score (1-5 scale) and as a binary severe presentation indicator based on clinical assessment.

**Geographic Variables**  
Geographic variables captured multiple levels of spatial organization relevant to healthcare access and outcomes. Hospital of admission was recorded for all participants. Residence information included district of residence (primary administrative unit), village or subcounty (local administrative unit), and regional classification (Central versus other regions). An urban versus rural classification was created based on residence in Kampala or Wakiso districts (classified as urban) versus other districts (classified as rural/peri-urban).

**Derived Variables**  
Several derived variables were created during analysis to enhance clinical interpretability and model performance. Age categories (18-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+ years) were created to capture nonlinear age effects appropriate for our young adult population. BMI categories followed WHO classifications (underweight <18.5, normal 18.5-24.9, overweight 25-29.9, obese ≥30 kg/m²).

Composite risk indicators included counts of abnormal vital signs and total comorbidity burden. A clinical severity indicator combined multiple clinical assessment components into a binary high versus low severity classification.

### **Statistical Analysis**

**Analysis Population and Missing Data**  
The primary analysis utilized complete case analysis including participants with complete data for the primary outcome and core predictor variables. Of 365 enrolled participants, 354 (97.0%) had complete data for the primary analysis. This excellent retention rate and minimal missing data (<5% for most variables) supported the complete case approach while maintaining statistical power and minimizing bias.

Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation were planned for key variables with missing data to assess the robustness of complete case findings. Missing data patterns were systematically evaluated to identify potential systematic mechanisms and inform imputation strategies if needed.

**Descriptive Analysis**  
Descriptive statistics utilized means and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous variables, medians and interquartile ranges for non-normally distributed variables, and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. Distribution normality was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk tests and visual inspection of histograms and Q-Q plots.

Baseline characteristics were compared between participants who died and survived using appropriate statistical tests: t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables, Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normal continuous variables, and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Effect sizes were reported using standardized mean differences for continuous variables and odds ratios for categorical variables.

**Mortality Prediction Model Development (Research Question 1)**  
Model development followed established guidelines for clinical prediction models, utilizing a systematic approach from univariable screening through final model validation.

*Univariable Analysis:* Each candidate predictor underwent individual logistic regression analysis with 30-day mortality as the outcome. A liberal inclusion criterion (p<0.20) was applied to avoid excluding potentially important predictors in this exploratory phase. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all predictors.

*Multivariable Model Development:* Predictors meeting the univariable screening criterion were entered into multivariable logistic regression models. Variable selection utilized backward elimination with a retention criterion of p<0.05. Collinearity was assessed using variance inflation factors, with VIF >10 indicating problematic collinearity requiring variable exclusion or combination.

Model assumptions including linearity of continuous predictors were assessed using fractional polynomial techniques and graphical residual analysis. The assumption of independence was supported by the study design, and adequate sample size was confirmed by the events-per-variable ratio exceeding 10:1.

*Model Performance Assessment:* Discrimination was evaluated using the C-statistic (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) with 95% confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap method. Values >0.70 were considered indicative of good discrimination. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and calibration plots comparing predicted versus observed mortality across risk deciles.

*Bootstrap Validation:* Internal validation utilized 200 bootstrap samples to assess optimism and provide bias-corrected performance estimates. This approach quantified the expected performance degradation when the model is applied to new patients from the same population.

*Risk Stratification:* Model predictions were used to classify patients into tertiles (low, moderate, high risk) to demonstrate clinical utility. The distribution of mortality rates across risk categories was evaluated to ensure meaningful risk differentiation.

**HIV-CAP Analysis (Research Question 2)**  
The analysis of HIV status as a mortality predictor utilized multiple complementary approaches to provide robust evidence.

*Comparative Analysis:* Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared between HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants using appropriate statistical tests. The primary comparison examined 30-day mortality rates using Fisher's exact test due to small cell counts in some categories.

*Propensity Score Analysis:* To address potential confounding, propensity score matching was implemented. A logistic regression model predicted HIV-positive status using baseline confounders including age, sex, BMI, and clinical severity indicators. Nearest neighbor matching with a caliper of 0.2 standard deviations was utilized to create matched pairs. Covariate balance was assessed using standardized mean differences, with values <0.10 indicating adequate balance.

*Subgroup Analyses:* Pre-specified subgroup analyses examined HIV effects across clinically relevant strata including age groups (<40 versus ≥40 years), BMI categories (underweight versus normal/overweight), and clinical severity levels. These analyses tested whether HIV effects varied according to patient characteristics.

*Interaction Testing:* Formal statistical testing for interactions between HIV status and other predictors was conducted using likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without interaction terms.

**Clinical Risk Score Development (Research Question 3)**  
Development of a practical bedside risk score followed established methodology for clinical decision tools.

*Variable Selection:* Candidate variables for the clinical score were selected based on the mortality prediction model results, clinical importance, and bedside availability. Variables required odds ratios ≥1.5 and p<0.20 in univariable analysis for inclusion consideration.

*Clinical Cutpoint Selection:* For continuous variables, clinically meaningful cutpoints were selected based on established literature and clinical guidelines. For example, respiratory rate ≥30 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation <90% represent standard thresholds for severe respiratory compromise.

*Score Development:* A multivariable logistic regression model using the selected clinical predictors generated β-coefficients that were converted to integer point values through established scoring methodologies. Points were assigned proportional to β-coefficients and rounded to facilitate bedside calculation.

*Score Validation:* The clinical score's performance was evaluated using C-statistic analysis and compared to the full continuous model. Risk stratification effectiveness was assessed by examining mortality rates across score categories. Bootstrap validation (100 iterations) provided bias-corrected performance estimates.

*Optimal Cutpoint Analysis:* The Youden index method identified optimal cutpoints for binary classification, balancing sensitivity and specificity. Clinical utility was evaluated through decision curve analysis when appropriate.

**Geographic Analysis**  
Geographic patterns were analyzed at multiple spatial scales to identify healthcare system and population health insights.

*Hospital-Level Analysis:* Outcomes were compared across the three study hospitals using Fisher's exact tests for small samples and chi-square tests for larger comparisons. Hospital-specific mortality rates and HIV prevalence were calculated with exact confidence intervals.

*District and Regional Analysis:* District-level analysis focused on districts with adequate sample sizes (≥20 participants) to ensure stable estimates. Urban versus rural comparisons utilized the residence-based classification system.

*Statistical Methods:* Geographic comparisons used appropriate statistical tests based on sample sizes and data distributions. Small sample comparisons utilized exact methods while larger samples employed asymptotic tests.

**Software and Reproducibility**  
All analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.0 with specific packages including dplyr for data manipulation, pROC for ROC analysis, ggplot2 for visualization, boot for bootstrap procedures, Hmisc for statistical functions, VIM for missing data visualization, tableone for descriptive statistics, and MatchIt for propensity score matching.

Reproducibility was ensured through systematic seed setting (set.seed(123)) for all random processes including bootstrap procedures and model validation. All analysis code is available upon request and documented in comprehensive analysis logs.

Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 for all tests, with exact p-values reported for all comparisons. Confidence intervals were calculated at the 95% level throughout. Multiple comparison adjustments were not applied given the exploratory nature of the analysis and limited number of primary hypotheses.
