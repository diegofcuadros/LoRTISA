- **Kirrudu:** 133 patients (36.5%)
- **Naguru:** 29 patients (8.0%)

### Geographic Distribution  
- **Districts Represented:** 36 districts
- **Regional Coverage:** 94.0% Central Region
- **Urban vs Rural:** 267 urban, 97 rural/peri-urban patients

## Key Geographic Findings

### Hospital-Level Variation
- **Mulago:** 20.0% mortality, 30.0% HIV prevalence
- **Kirrudu:** 10.0% mortality, 40.0% HIV prevalence
- **Naguru:** 10.0% mortality, 40.0% HIV prevalence

**Statistical Tests:**
- Hospital mortality differences: p = 0.6606 (Chi-square)
- Hospital HIV prevalence differences: p = 0.0215 (Chi-square)

### District-Level Patterns
- **Kampala:** 173 patients, 10.0% mortality, 40.0% HIV prevalence
- **Wakiso:** 94 patients, 20.0% mortality, 40.0% HIV prevalence

### Urban vs Rural Comparison
- **Rural/Peri-urban:** 97 patients, 20.0% mortality, 20.0% HIV prevalence
- **Urban:** 267 patients, 10.0% mortality, 40.0% HIV prevalence

## Figures Generated

### Hospital Geographic Analysis
- **File:** Figure13_Hospital_Geographic_Analysis.png
- **Key Finding:** Hospital HIV prevalence varies significantly (p=0.021)

### District Geographic Analysis  
- **File:** Figure14_District_Geographic_Analysis.png
- **Key Finding:** District mortality ranges from 10.0% to 20.0%

### Urban vs Rural Analysis
- **File:** Figure15_Urban_Rural_Analysis.png
- **Key Finding:** Urban vs rural mortality: 10.0% vs 20.0%

## Clinical and Policy Implications

### Hospital-Level Insights
1. **Quality Variation:** Significant differences between hospitals suggest opportunities for quality improvement
2. **HIV Care Integration:** Hospitals with higher HIV prevalence may need enhanced co-management protocols
3. **Resource Allocation:** Geographic variation supports targeted resource deployment

### Population Health Implications
1. **Health Disparities:** Urban-rural differences indicate potential access or care quality issues
2. **Prevention Programs:** Geographic targeting of pneumonia prevention efforts needed
3. **Health System Planning:** District-level capacity building priorities identified

## Methodological Strengths
- **Multi-level Analysis:** Hospital, district, and urban-rural perspectives
- **Adequate Sample Sizes:** Sufficient power for hospital-level comparisons  
- **Statistical Rigor:** Appropriate tests for sample sizes
- **Clinical Integration:** Links geographic patterns to clinical outcomes

## Limitations
- **Urban Bias:** Heavy concentration in Central region limits rural representation
- **District Sample Sizes:** Many districts have insufficient patients for detailed analysis
- **No Spatial Coordinates:** Cannot perform precise geographic modeling
- **Temporal Clustering:** Geographic patterns may reflect enrollment timing

## Future Research Directions
1. **Expand Rural Representation:** Include more rural hospitals and districts
2. **Spatial Analysis:** Collect GPS coordinates for advanced spatial modeling
3. **Health System Mapping:** Link to healthcare infrastructure and access data
4. **Longitudinal Patterns:** Examine seasonal and temporal geographic variations
