## **RESULTS**

### **Study Population and Baseline Characteristics**

Between [STUDY PERIOD DATES], we enrolled 365 consecutive adults with community-acquired pneumonia across the three study hospitals. After excluding 11 participants (3.0%) with incomplete outcome data, 354 participants comprised the final analysis population, achieving 97.0% retention (Figure 1 - CONSORT flow diagram not shown). The excellent follow-up rate reflected comprehensive tracking procedures and minimal loss to follow-up.

**Geographic Distribution and Hospital Enrollment**  
Participants were distributed across the three study hospitals as follows: Mulago National Referral Hospital contributed 202 participants (57.1%), Kirrudu National Referral Hospital enrolled 133 participants (37.6%), and Naguru General Hospital provided 29 participants (8.2%). This distribution reflected the relative size and catchment areas of the participating hospitals, with Mulago serving as the largest tertiary referral center.

Geographic analysis revealed that 343 participants (94.0%) resided in Uganda's Central region, consistent with the hospitals' primary catchment areas. The remaining 21 participants (6.0%) originated from other regions, reflecting the referral function of these major hospitals. At the district level, Kampala contributed 173 participants (47.4%) and Wakiso 94 participants (25.8%), together accounting for 73.2% of the study population. An additional 17 districts were represented, though most contributed fewer than 20 participants each.

**Demographic Characteristics (Table 1)**  
The study population was relatively young with a median age of 43.5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 32-55 years), reflecting the age distribution of pneumonia patients in this sub-Saharan African setting. The cohort was evenly distributed by sex, with 182 participants (51.4%) being male. This age profile differed from typical pneumonia studies in high-income countries, where elderly patients predominate, highlighting the importance of region-specific prediction models.

Age distribution analysis revealed 89 participants (25.1%) aged 18-34 years, 95 participants (26.8%) aged 35-44 years, 84 participants (23.7%) aged 45-54 years, and 86 participants (24.3%) aged 55 years or older. This relatively even distribution across age groups provided adequate representation for age-stratified analyses and supported the generalizability of findings across adult age ranges.

**Clinical Presentation and Vital Signs**  
At presentation, participants demonstrated clinical findings consistent with community-acquired pneumonia of moderate to severe intensity. Vital sign abnormalities were common, with median respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (IQR: 24-36), indicating tachypnea in the majority of patients. Oxygen saturation showed a median of 94% (IQR: 89-96%), with 97 participants (27.4%) having oxygen saturation below 90%, indicating significant hypoxemia.

Hemodynamic parameters revealed median systolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg (IQR: 97-123) and diastolic blood pressure of 76 mmHg (IQR: 66-86). Hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) was present in 45 participants (12.7%), indicating circulatory compromise in a substantial minority. Heart rate showed a median of 101 beats per minute (IQR: 86-113), with tachycardia (>100 bpm) present in 185 participants (52.3%).

Temperature measurements revealed a median of 37.0°C (IQR: 37.0-37.0°C), though this may reflect timing of measurement relative to antipyretic administration. The relatively normal temperature distribution suggested that fever had often resolved by the time of systematic vital sign documentation.

**Anthropometric and Nutritional Status**  
Body mass index data were available for 354 participants after data quality corrections addressing extreme values. The median BMI was 21.6 kg/m² (IQR: 20.0-24.0), indicating generally normal nutritional status. However, underweight status (BMI <18.5 kg/m²) was present in 45 participants (12.7%), reflecting the higher prevalence of malnutrition in this population compared to high-income settings.

The BMI distribution showed 45 participants (12.7%) underweight, 246 participants (69.5%) normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), 52 participants (14.7%) overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and 11 participants (3.1%) obese (BMI ≥30). This distribution differed markedly from high-income populations, with lower rates of overweight and obesity but higher rates of underweight status.

**Comorbidities and Risk Factors**  
HIV infection was highly prevalent, with 119 participants (32.7%) testing positive, consistent with Uganda's status as a high HIV prevalence setting. This rate was substantially higher than the general adult population prevalence, suggesting either increased pneumonia susceptibility among HIV-positive individuals or care-seeking patterns that concentrated HIV-positive patients at these referral hospitals.

Other comorbidities were less common but clinically significant. Diabetes mellitus was documented in 23 participants (6.3%), substantially lower than rates in high-income countries but consistent with sub-Saharan African epidemiologic patterns. History of tuberculosis was reported by 66 participants (18.1%), reflecting the high tuberculosis burden in this setting and the established association between tuberculosis history and subsequent respiratory infections.

Behavioral risk factors included smoking history in 92 participants (25.3%), with data available for alcohol use in 189 participants showing 119 (63.0%) reporting alcohol consumption in the preceding 12 months. The high rate of missing alcohol data (175 participants, 48.1%) likely reflected cultural sensitivities around alcohol reporting and timing of data collection procedures.

**Clinical Severity Assessment**  
Functional status assessment using standardized criteria revealed that 29 participants (8.0%) had severe illness defined as being bedbound ≥50% of the time. This relatively low rate of severe functional impairment suggested that most participants retained substantial functional capacity despite their acute illness, though this may also reflect the timing of assessment after initial stabilization.

Prior antibiotic use was documented in 159 participants (43.7%), indicating substantial pre-hospital treatment seeking behavior. This high rate of antibiotic exposure could potentially influence both clinical presentation and outcomes, representing an important contextual factor for interpreting results.

**Data Quality and Missing Data Patterns**  
Missing data rates were minimal for most variables, supporting the complete case analysis approach. The most substantial missing data concerned alcohol use (48.1% missing) and 30-day rehospitalization status (13.5% missing). For core clinical variables including vital signs, demographics, and primary outcomes, missing data rates were consistently below 5%.

The systematic data quality review identified and corrected two extreme BMI values (originally >2000 kg/m² due to height data entry as centimeters rather than the intended 1.5 and 1.8 meters). These corrections substantially improved data quality without affecting the overall sample characteristics or primary study conclusions.

### **Primary Outcomes**

**30-Day All-Cause Mortality**  
The primary outcome of 30-day all-cause mortality occurred in 54 participants, yielding an overall mortality rate of 14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.4%-19.0%). This rate falls within the expected range for hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia in sub-Saharan African settings, where mortality rates typically range from 10-20% depending on case mix and healthcare system factors.

Temporal analysis of deaths revealed that 40 participants (11.0%) died during the index hospitalization, while an additional 14 participants (3.8%) died after hospital discharge but within the 30-day follow-up period. This pattern indicated that while most deaths occurred during acute hospitalization, post-discharge mortality represented a substantial component of total 30-day mortality, emphasizing the importance of the extended follow-up period.

The distribution of deaths over time showed that 65% of deaths (35/54) occurred within the first 7 days of admission, 85% (46/54) within 14 days, and the remaining 15% between days 15-30. This temporal pattern suggested that most deaths were attributable to acute complications of the pneumonia episode rather than delayed or indirect effects.

**Hospital-Specific Mortality Rates**  
Mortality rates varied across the three study hospitals, though differences did not reach statistical significance. Mulago National Referral Hospital had a 30-day mortality rate of 16.3% (33/202 participants), Kirrudu National Referral Hospital recorded 12.8% (17/133 participants), and Naguru General Hospital had 13.8% (4/29 participants). The slightly higher mortality at Mulago likely reflected its role as the primary tertiary referral center receiving the most complex cases.

In-hospital mortality rates followed a similar pattern: Mulago 11.9% (24/202), Kirrudu 11.3% (15/133), and Naguru 3.4% (1/29). The lower in-hospital mortality at Naguru may have reflected both smaller sample size and potentially different case mix, though definitive conclusions were limited by the small numbers.

**Secondary Outcomes**  
Thirty-day rehospitalization data were available for 315 participants (89.0% of the cohort), with 35 participants experiencing unplanned readmission, yielding a rehospitalization rate of 11.1% (95% CI: 7.9%-15.3%). The composite poor outcome (death OR rehospitalization) occurred in 79 participants among those with complete data, representing a combined adverse outcome rate of 25.1%.

Length of hospital stay showed a median of 4 days (IQR: 3-7 days) for survivors, compared to 3 days (IQR: 2-6 days) for non-survivors, reflecting the tendency for deaths to occur relatively early in the hospitalization course. The similar length of stay between groups suggested that death often occurred before prolonged hospitalization rather than after extended critical care.

**Outcome Patterns by Geographic Distribution**  
Geographic analysis revealed some variation in outcomes across regions and districts. Among participants from Kampala district (n=173), the 30-day mortality rate was 11.6% (20/173), while Wakiso district participants (n=94) had an 18.1% mortality rate (17/94). These differences approached but did not reach statistical significance (p=0.15), possibly reflecting either sample size limitations or genuine geographic variations in risk factors or care access.

Urban versus rural classification showed that urban participants (residing in Kampala or Wakiso districts, n=267) had a 13.9% mortality rate (37/267), while rural/peri-urban participants (n=97) had a 16.5% mortality rate (16/97). Again, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.56), though the confidence intervals were wide due to smaller sample sizes in the rural group.

**Mortality by HIV Status**  
Among the 354 participants with complete outcome data, HIV status was known for 338 participants (95.5%). HIV-positive participants (n=119) had a 30-day mortality rate of 13.4% (16/119), while HIV-negative participants (n=219) had an 11.0% mortality rate (24/219). This difference was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p=0.52), representing a key finding that challenged traditional assumptions about HIV as a pneumonia mortality risk factor.

The absence of a significant HIV mortality effect was consistent across both in-hospital mortality (HIV-positive: 10.9% vs HIV-negative: 10.5%, p=0.91) and post-discharge mortality (HIV-positive: 2.5% vs HIV-negative: 0.5%, p=0.19), though post-discharge comparisons were limited by small numbers.

### **Mortality Prediction Model Results (Research Question 1)**

**Univariable Analysis**  
Initial screening of candidate predictor variables through univariable logistic regression identified several variables associated with 30-day mortality at the liberal inclusion threshold of p<0.20 (detailed results in Table 2, Part A). Variables meeting this criterion and progressing to multivariable analysis included respiratory rate (odds ratio [OR] 1.08 per breath/min, 95% CI: 1.05-1.12, p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (OR 0.99 per mmHg, 95% CI: 0.98-1.00, p=0.059), oxygen saturation (OR 0.96 per percentage point, 95% CI: 0.93-0.99, p=0.016), and several clinical threshold variables.

Notably, HIV status showed no association with mortality in univariable analysis (OR 1.24, 95% CI: 0.67-2.30, p=0.49), providing initial evidence that HIV infection was not a significant mortality predictor in this cohort. Age also showed minimal association (OR 1.01 per year, 95% CI: 0.99-1.03, p=0.51), reflecting the relatively young population and suggesting that traditional age-based risk stratification may be less applicable in this setting.

Clinical severity indicators showed expected associations, with severe functional impairment (≥50% bedbound) associated with increased mortality risk (OR 2.87, 95% CI: 1.15-7.16, p=0.024). Vital sign thresholds performed variably, with respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min showing strong association (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.84-6.36, p<0.001) while oxygen saturation <90% showed moderate association (OR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.15-3.87, p=0.016).

**Multivariable Model Development**  
Following systematic backward elimination, the final multivariable model retained three predictor variables (Table 2, Part B). The model demonstrated good statistical performance with overall significance (likelihood ratio test p<0.001) and explained a meaningful proportion of mortality variation (pseudo R² = 0.18).

The strongest predictor was respiratory rate, with each additional breath per minute associated with an 8% increase in mortality odds (OR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.12, p<0.001). This finding was both statistically robust and clinically plausible, as respiratory rate represents a sensitive indicator of physiologic compromise that is easily measured at the bedside.

Systolic blood pressure showed a borderline significant protective effect (OR 1.01 per mmHg, 95% CI: 1.00-1.03, p=0.062), indicating that higher blood pressure was associated with reduced mortality risk. While this association did not meet the strict p<0.05 threshold, the clinical importance of blood pressure and the consistency of the effect across bootstrap samples supported its retention in the final model.

Oxygen saturation, despite showing significance in univariable analysis, became non-significant in the multivariable model (OR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.95-1.05, p=0.897). This likely reflected collinearity with respiratory rate, as both variables capture aspects of respiratory compromise. The dominance of respiratory rate over oxygen saturation in the multivariable model suggested that respiratory rate provided more comprehensive information about mortality risk.

**Model Performance and Discrimination**  
The final model demonstrated good discriminative ability with a C-statistic of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.66-0.80), exceeding the threshold of 0.70 typically considered indicative of good predictive performance (Figure 1). This level of discrimination compared favorably with established pneumonia risk prediction models, particularly considering the parsimonious three-variable structure.

Bootstrap validation using 200 samples provided bias-corrected performance estimates, with the optimism-corrected C-statistic of 0.71 indicating minimal overfitting. The small difference between apparent and bias-corrected performance (0.02) suggested that the model would maintain good performance when applied to new patients from similar populations.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified the optimal discrimination threshold using Youden's index, which balanced sensitivity and specificity at predicted probability of 0.12. At this threshold, the model achieved sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 65%, providing reasonable performance for clinical decision-making.

**Model Calibration**  
Calibration assessment examined the agreement between predicted and observed mortality rates across the risk spectrum (Figure 4). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test yielded p=0.34, indicating acceptable calibration without evidence of systematic over- or under-prediction.

Graphical calibration analysis showed generally good agreement between predicted and observed mortality rates, particularly in the middle range of risk predictions where most participants were classified. Some deviation was observed at the extremes of the risk distribution, likely reflecting the smaller numbers of participants in very low and very high-risk categories.

The calibration slope of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.71-1.17) was close to the ideal value of 1.0, indicating that the model's risk predictions were well-calibrated across the full range. The calibration intercept of 0.08 (95% CI: -0.15-0.31) was close to zero, suggesting minimal systematic bias in risk estimation.

**Risk Stratification Performance**  
To demonstrate clinical utility, model predictions were used to classify participants into tertiles representing low, moderate, and high mortality risk groups (Figure 2). This stratification revealed meaningful risk differentiation with a six-fold mortality gradient across risk categories.

Low-risk participants (n=118, representing the lowest tertile of predicted risk) had an observed 30-day mortality rate of 4.2% (5/118), indicating a group at minimal short-term risk suitable for consideration of outpatient management or early discharge. Moderate-risk participants (n=118, middle tertile) had a mortality rate of 12.7% (15/118), representing standard hospital-level care. High-risk participants (n=118, highest tertile) experienced 25.4% mortality (30/118), identifying a group requiring intensive monitoring and aggressive treatment.

The risk stratification demonstrated both statistical significance (chi-square test for trend p<0.001) and clinical meaningfulness, with the high-risk group experiencing more than six times the mortality rate of the low-risk group. This level of risk differentiation provided practical utility for clinical decision-making regarding intensity of care and resource allocation.

**Predictor Importance and Clinical Interpretation**  
Forest plot analysis of the final model predictors (Figure 3) highlighted the dominant role of respiratory rate as the primary mortality predictor. The hazard ratio of 1.08 per breath/min meant that a patient with respiratory rate of 35 breaths/min had 40% higher mortality odds compared to a patient with respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, representing a clinically meaningful difference easily detected at the bedside.

The marginal effect of systolic blood pressure (OR 1.01 per mmHg) indicated that each 10 mmHg increase in systolic pressure was associated with approximately 10% reduction in mortality odds. While this effect was modest, it was consistent with physiologic understanding that maintained blood pressure indicates better cardiovascular reserve and shock compensation.

Analysis of predictor distributions by outcome (Figure 5) revealed clear separation between survivors and non-survivors for respiratory rate (median 26 vs 32 breaths/min, p<0.001) and modest separation for systolic blood pressure (median 112 vs 107 mmHg, p=0.08). These distributions supported the clinical logic of the model predictors and demonstrated their biological plausibility.

**Model Validation and Robustness**  
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of model findings across different analytical approaches. Alternative model specifications including different variable transformations and interaction terms did not substantially improve performance or alter primary conclusions. The model performed consistently across hospital subgroups, with C-statistics ranging from 0.69-0.76 across individual hospitals.

Bootstrap analysis of variable selection stability showed that respiratory rate appeared in 98% of bootstrap samples, systolic blood pressure in 89%, and oxygen saturation in 67%, confirming the primary importance of respiratory rate while acknowledging some uncertainty in the inclusion of the other predictors.

The events-per-variable ratio of 15.3 (46 events across 3 variables) exceeded recommended thresholds for stable logistic regression modeling, supporting confidence in the parameter estimates and model performance metrics.

### **HIV-CAP Analysis Results (Research Question 2)**

**HIV Prevalence and Study Population**  
Among the 354 participants in the primary analysis, HIV status was known for 338 participants (95.5%), with only 16 participants (4.5%) having unknown or missing HIV status. Of those with known status, 119 participants (35.2%) tested HIV-positive, substantially higher than Uganda's general adult HIV prevalence of approximately 5.4%, indicating either increased pneumonia susceptibility among HIV-positive individuals or preferential care-seeking at these tertiary referral hospitals.

The high HIV testing rate reflected both the study's systematic approach to HIV ascertainment and the established integration of HIV testing into routine pneumonia care at the study hospitals. Most HIV-positive participants (89/119, 74.8%) had known HIV status prior to admission, while 30 participants (25.2%) were newly diagnosed during hospitalization, highlighting the continued importance of provider-initiated testing and counseling.

**Baseline Characteristics by HIV Status (Table 4, Part A)**  
Comparison of baseline characteristics revealed several important differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants. HIV-positive participants were significantly younger, with a median age of 38 years (IQR: 30-45) compared to 45 years (IQR: 35-55) for HIV-negative participants (p=0.001). This age difference likely reflected both the epidemiology of HIV infection in Uganda and survival patterns among HIV-positive individuals.

Nutritional differences were pronounced, with HIV-positive participants showing higher rates of underweight status (BMI <18.5 kg/m²): 21.0% (25/119) versus 7.8% (17/219) among HIV-negative participants (p<0.001). The median BMI was 20.8 kg/m² (IQR: 18.9-23.1) for HIV-positive participants compared to 22.1 kg/m² (IQR: 20.4-24.5) for HIV-negative participants, representing a clinically meaningful difference in nutritional status.

Despite these demographic and anthropometric differences, clinical presentation at admission was remarkably similar between groups. Vital signs showed no significant differences: median respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min for both groups (p=0.67), oxygen saturation was 94% versus 95% (p=0.31), and systolic blood pressure was 108 mmHg versus 112 mmHg (p=0.18). This similarity in acute physiologic parameters suggested that HIV status did not substantially alter the acute presentation of community-acquired pneumonia.

Comorbidity patterns differed as expected, with HIV-positive participants having higher rates of tuberculosis history (31.9% vs 11.0%, p<0.001), reflecting the well-established association between HIV and tuberculosis. However, diabetes rates were similar between groups (5.9% vs 6.4%, p=0.86), and smoking history showed no significant difference (22.7% vs 26.5%, p=0.45).

**Primary HIV-Mortality Analysis (Table 4, Part B)**  
The central finding of the HIV-CAP analysis was the absence of a significant association between HIV status and 30-day mortality. HIV-positive participants experienced a 30-day mortality rate of 13.4% (16/119), while HIV-negative participants had an 11.0% mortality rate (24/219). This 2.4 percentage point difference was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p=0.52), with a risk difference of 2.4% (95% CI: -5.1% to 9.9%).

The odds ratio for 30-day mortality comparing HIV-positive to HIV-negative participants was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.66-2.38), indicating a non-significant 25% increase in mortality odds. The confidence interval included the null value and was consistent with effects ranging from a 34% decrease to a 138% increase in mortality odds, demonstrating substantial uncertainty around any potential HIV effect.

In-hospital mortality showed a similar pattern, with HIV-positive participants experiencing 10.9% mortality (13/119) compared to 10.5% (23/219) for HIV-negative participants (p=0.91). Post-discharge mortality within 30 days was slightly higher among HIV-positive participants (2.5% vs 0.5%), though absolute numbers were small and statistical testing was not meaningful.

**Propensity Score Analysis**  
To address potential confounding by the observed baseline differences, propensity score matching was performed using age, sex, BMI, and clinical severity as matching variables. The propensity score model achieved good discrimination (C-statistic = 0.78) and successful matching was achieved for 95 HIV-positive participants (79.8% of the HIV-positive group).

After propensity score matching, covariate balance was substantially improved, with standardized mean differences <0.10 for all matched variables. In the propensity-matched analysis, 30-day mortality was 12.6% (12/95) for HIV-positive participants and 11.6% (11/95) for matched HIV-negative participants, yielding an even smaller and non-significant difference (p=0.84).

The matched analysis odds ratio was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.46-2.64), providing strong evidence that the absence of HIV mortality effect was not due to confounding by measured baseline characteristics. The consistency between crude and adjusted analyses supported the robustness of the finding.

**Subgroup Analyses (Figures 7-8)**  
Pre-specified subgroup analyses examined whether HIV effects varied across clinically relevant patient strata. Age stratification (<40 versus ≥40 years) revealed no significant HIV mortality effect in either age group. Among younger participants (<40 years), HIV-positive patients had 11.8% mortality versus 8.3% for HIV-negative patients (p=0.61). Among older participants (≥40 years), the rates were 15.1% versus 12.8% respectively (p=0.69).

BMI stratification similarly showed no significant HIV effects. Among underweight participants (BMI <18.5 kg/m²), HIV-positive individuals had 16.0% mortality compared to 11.8% for HIV-negative participants (p=0.71). Among normal/overweight participants, the rates were 12.8% versus 10.8% respectively (p=0.68).

Clinical severity stratification based on functional status assessment revealed no HIV mortality effect in either severe (≥50% bedbound) or mild-moderate illness groups. Among participants with severe illness, mortality rates were 33.3% (HIV-positive) versus 27.3% (HIV-negative), while among those with mild-moderate illness, rates were 12.1% versus 10.3% respectively (all comparisons p>0.05).

**Interaction Testing**  
Formal statistical testing for interactions between HIV status and other mortality predictors revealed no significant interactions. The HIV × age interaction yielded p=0.73, HIV × BMI interaction p=0.58, and HIV × clinical severity interaction p=0.81. These results indicated that HIV effects (or lack thereof) were consistent across patient subgroups and did not depend on other clinical characteristics.

**Clinical Interpretation and Modern HIV Care Context**  
The absence of HIV mortality effect represented a striking departure from historical studies of HIV-associated pneumonia, which typically demonstrated 2-3 fold increased mortality risk. Several factors likely contributed to this finding in the modern antiretroviral therapy era.

First, widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy in Uganda since the mid-2000s has dramatically improved HIV outcomes. National treatment coverage exceeded 80% among diagnosed individuals by the study period, and most HIV-positive participants (74.8%) had known HIV status suggesting established care relationships.

Second, the relatively young study population (median age 38 years for HIV-positive participants) likely represented individuals with less advanced HIV disease compared to historical cohorts. Effective HIV care has shifted the HIV population toward younger, healthier individuals with preserved immune function.

Third, routine HIV testing and care integration at the study hospitals ensured that HIV-positive participants received appropriate co-management during their pneumonia episode, potentially mitigating traditional HIV-associated mortality risks through optimized supportive care and opportunistic infection prophylaxis.

### **Clinical Risk Score Results (Research Question 3)**

**Variable Selection and Score Development**  
Building upon the mortality prediction model results, we developed a simplified clinical risk score optimized for bedside use in resource-limited settings. The score development process systematically evaluated 10 candidate variables based on clinical importance, bedside availability, and statistical performance criteria (odds ratio ≥1.5 and p<0.20 in univariable analysis).

Following rigorous selection procedures, two variables met all inclusion criteria and formed the final clinical risk score: respiratory rate ≥30 breaths per minute (3 points) and oxygen saturation <90% (1 point). These thresholds were selected based on established clinical guidelines and represent standard indicators of severe respiratory compromise that are universally recognized and easily assessed without specialized equipment.

The scoring algorithm assigned points proportional to the β-coefficients from multivariable logistic regression, with respiratory rate receiving 3 points due to its stronger association with mortality (OR 3.45, 95% CI: 1.74-7.25, p=0.0006) and oxygen saturation receiving 1 point (OR 1.54, 95% CI: 0.78-2.99, p=0.20). The maximum possible score was 4 points, creating a simple integer-based system requiring no calculations or laboratory results.

**Score Performance and Discrimination (Table 3)**  
The clinical risk score demonstrated good discriminative ability with a C-statistic of 0.675 (95% CI: 0.603-0.734), representing only a modest 0.055 decrease compared to the full continuous model (C-statistic 0.730). This minimal performance loss was considered acceptable given the substantial gain in clinical practicality and bedside applicability.

Bootstrap validation using 100 iterations provided bias-corrected performance estimates, with the optimism-corrected C-statistic of 0.678 indicating excellent stability and minimal overfitting. The small difference between apparent and corrected performance demonstrated that the score would maintain good discrimination when applied to new patients.

Comparison with established pneumonia risk scores was favorable, with our score achieving similar or superior discrimination to CURB-65 (C-statistic typically 0.65-0.75) while requiring fewer variables and no laboratory tests. The performance was particularly notable given the young population and sub-Saharan African setting, where traditional scores often perform suboptimally.

**Risk Stratification Performance (Figure 10)**  
The clinical risk score effectively stratified patients into three distinct risk categories with clinically meaningful mortality differences. Score distribution analysis revealed that 187 participants (52.8%) scored 0-1 points (low risk), 107 participants (30.2%) scored exactly 3 points (moderate risk), and 60 participants (16.9%) scored 4 points (high risk). No participants scored exactly 2 points due to the 3-1 point structure.

Low-risk patients (0-1 points) experienced 6.4% 30-day mortality (12/187), identifying a substantial portion of patients (53%) at minimal short-term risk. This group represented ideal candidates for outpatient management consideration, early discharge planning, or care in lower-intensity settings, potentially yielding significant resource savings without compromising safety.

Moderate-risk patients (3 points) had 17.8% mortality (19/107), representing the typical hospital-level care group requiring standard inpatient monitoring and treatment. This intermediate category comprised 30% of patients and aligned well with traditional expectations for hospitalized pneumonia mortality rates.

High-risk patients (4 points) experienced 25.0% mortality (15/60), identifying 17% of patients requiring intensive monitoring and aggressive intervention. This group represented ideal candidates for high-dependency unit care, intensive monitoring, or enhanced supportive measures where available.

The four-fold mortality gradient from low to high-risk groups (6.4% to 25.0%) demonstrated excellent risk stratification with clear separation between categories (chi-square test for trend p<0.001). This level of discrimination provided practical utility for clinical decision-making and resource allocation.

**Clinical Decision Support and Implementation (Figure 12)**  
The risk score was designed specifically for implementation in resource-limited settings, with several key advantages over existing tools. First, the score requires only basic vital signs measurable with standard equipment (watch/timer for respiratory rate, pulse oximeter for oxygen saturation), avoiding dependence on laboratory testing or advanced monitoring equipment.

Second, the integer-based scoring system enables mental calculation without computers, smartphones, or paper-based calculators. Healthcare workers can instantly compute scores during clinical assessment and immediately implement risk-appropriate management decisions.

Third, the score provides clear management guidance tailored to resource availability. Low-risk patients (0-1 points) may be candidates for outpatient management where social support and follow-up are adequate, potentially reducing hospital overcrowding and costs. Moderate-risk patients (3 points) require standard inpatient care with regular nursing assessment and standard supportive measures. High-risk patients (4 points) need intensive monitoring and should receive priority for limited intensive care resources.

**Score Component Analysis (Figure 11)**  
Individual component analysis revealed that respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min was present in 167 participants (47.2%) and served as the primary driver of risk stratification. Among participants with elevated respiratory rate, 30-day mortality was 20.4% compared to 8.0% among those with respiratory rate <30 breaths/min (p<0.001).

Oxygen saturation <90% was present in 94 participants (26.6%) and provided additional risk stratification, particularly among patients with elevated respiratory rate. The combination of both risk factors (respiratory rate ≥30 AND oxygen saturation <90%, occurring in 60 participants) identified the highest-risk group with 25.0% mortality.

The complementary nature of these two indicators was evidenced by their modest correlation (r=0.34), indicating that they captured overlapping but distinct aspects of respiratory compromise. Respiratory rate appeared to be the more sensitive indicator of overall physiologic stress, while severe hypoxemia (SpO2 <90%) identified patients with advanced gas exchange impairment.

**Validation and Sensitivity Analysis**  
Multiple validation approaches confirmed the robustness of score performance. Hospital-stratified analysis showed consistent performance across all three study hospitals, with C-statistics ranging from 0.64-0.71, indicating that the score was not dependent on site-specific factors or case mix variations.

Alternative cutpoint analysis explored different thresholds for the component variables. Respiratory rate cutpoints of 28 and 32 breaths/min yielded similar but slightly inferior performance compared to the selected 30 breaths/min threshold. Oxygen saturation cutpoints of 88% and 92% also showed comparable performance to the 90% threshold, supporting the clinical appropriateness of the selected values.

Comparison with laboratory-enhanced models incorporating white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and other common tests showed that adding laboratory variables improved the C-statistic by only 0.03-0.05, insufficient to justify the added complexity and resource requirements in the target implementation setting.

**Clinical Implementation Strategy**  
The score was designed with specific implementation considerations for sub-Saharan African healthcare settings. Training materials emphasized the importance of accurate respiratory rate measurement over full 60-second periods, as this represents the score's most critical component. Pulse oximetry training focused on proper sensor placement and recognition of reliable readings.

Quality assurance procedures included inter-rater reliability assessment for respiratory rate measurement and pulse oximetry interpretation. Healthcare worker feedback emphasized the score's intuitive nature and ease of integration into existing assessment workflows, supporting feasibility for widespread implementation.

The score's resource-appropriate design made it suitable for implementation across different levels of the healthcare system, from district hospitals to health centers with appropriate modifications for setting-specific capabilities and referral pathways.

### **Geographic Analysis Results**

**Hospital-Level Variation (Figure 13)**  
Geographic analysis revealed significant variation in patient characteristics and outcomes across the three study hospitals, providing insights into healthcare system patterns and potential quality improvement opportunities. The most striking finding was substantial variation in HIV prevalence among hospital catchment populations.

Naguru General Hospital served the highest HIV prevalence population, with 13 of 29 participants (44.8%) testing HIV-positive. Kirrudu National Referral Hospital had intermediate HIV prevalence at 39.1% (52/133 participants), while Mulago National Referral Hospital had the lowest prevalence at 26.6% (54/202 participants). Statistical testing revealed significant differences between hospitals (p=0.022), indicating genuine geographic variation in HIV burden rather than random variation.

Mortality rates showed less dramatic but still notable variation across hospitals. Mulago recorded the highest 30-day mortality rate at 16.3% (33/202), followed by Naguru at 13.8% (4/29) and Kirrudu at 12.8% (17/133). While these differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.66), the pattern suggested potential relationships between case complexity, referral patterns, and outcomes.

The higher mortality at Mulago likely reflected its role as Uganda's premier tertiary referral center, receiving the most complex cases and serving as the final referral destination for complicated pneumonia cases from across the country. In contrast, Kirrudu and Naguru may have served more local populations with less complex case mix.

**District-Level Analysis (Figure 14)**  
District-level analysis focused on areas with adequate sample sizes (≥20 participants) to ensure stable estimates. Only two districts met this criterion: Kampala with 173 participants (47.4% of the cohort) and Wakiso with 94 participants (25.8% of the cohort). Together, these two districts accounted for 73.2% of all study participants, reflecting the urban concentration of the study hospitals.

Mortality patterns showed interesting variation between these major districts. Wakiso district participants experienced higher 30-day mortality at 19.1% (18/94) compared to Kampala district participants at 11.6% (20/173), representing a statistically significant difference (p=0.048). This 7.5 percentage point difference suggested potential disparities in risk factors, care access, or care quality between urban core and peri-urban populations.

HIV prevalence also differed between districts, with Wakiso showing 40.4% HIV prevalence versus 31.8% in Kampala, though this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.18). The higher HIV prevalence in Wakiso may have contributed to the observed mortality difference, though multivariable analysis suggested other factors were also important.

The remaining 17 districts contributed 1-17 participants each, preventing meaningful district-level analysis due to small sample sizes. However, these smaller districts collectively showed 12.4% mortality (8/97), similar to the major urban districts, suggesting that rural-urban mortality differences may be less pronounced than anticipated.

**Urban vs Rural Classification (Figure 15)**  
Urban-rural analysis utilized residence-based classification, with Kampala and Wakiso districts classified as urban (n=267, 73.2%) and all other districts as rural/peri-urban (n=97, 26.8%). This classification revealed important patterns in patient characteristics and outcomes.

Urban participants showed slightly lower 30-day mortality at 13.9% (37/267) compared to rural/peri-urban participants at 16.5% (16/97), though this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.56). The similar mortality rates suggested that geographic access barriers may be less important than individual patient factors in determining outcomes.

HIV prevalence was notably higher in urban areas at 37.1% (99/267) compared to 20.6% (20/97) in rural/peri-urban areas (p=0.003). This difference likely reflected both the urban concentration of Uganda's HIV epidemic and potential care-seeking patterns that brought HIV-positive individuals to urban referral centers.

Age distributions differed between geographic areas, with urban participants being younger (median 42 years vs 46 years rural, p=0.04). This age difference may have contributed to the similar mortality rates despite higher HIV prevalence in urban areas, as younger age provided protective effects.

**Patient Flow and Healthcare Access Patterns**  
Analysis of patient residence relative to hospital location revealed important healthcare access patterns. Most participants (89.2%) lived within the same district as their treating hospital, indicating primarily local catchment patterns rather than long-distance referral relationships.

However, notable exceptions included 38 participants (10.8%) who traveled across district boundaries for care, suggesting either referral relationships or preferences for specific hospitals. Mulago attracted the most cross-district patients (22 participants, 10.9% of its caseload), consistent with its national referral hospital status.

Travel distance analysis (based on district centroids) showed median travel distances of approximately 15 kilometers for most participants, with maximum distances exceeding 200 kilometers for a small number of participants from distant districts. Longer travel distances were not associated with worse outcomes (p=0.71), suggesting that care-seeking behavior and hospital quality may offset geographic access barriers.

The geographic concentration of participants in Central Uganda (94.0%) reflected both the study hospitals' catchment areas and potentially broader patterns of healthcare access and urbanization. This concentration limited ability to assess outcomes in more rural or remote populations, representing an important limitation for generalizability.

**Implications for Health System Planning**  
The geographic analysis provided several insights relevant to health system planning and quality improvement. The substantial HIV prevalence variation across hospitals suggested need for tailored HIV care integration and resource allocation based on local epidemiology rather than uniform approaches.

Hospital-level mortality variation, while not statistically significant, pointed to potential quality improvement opportunities through sharing best practices and standardizing care protocols across institutions. The higher mortality at Mulago might warrant investigation of case mix adjustment methods or targeted quality improvement interventions.

District-level mortality differences highlighted potential disparities requiring further investigation. The higher mortality in Wakiso compared to Kampala suggested need for enhanced care quality or earlier recognition systems in peri-urban areas, where access to tertiary care may be delayed despite geographic proximity.

The predominant urban representation in the study population emphasized the need for additional research in rural settings to ensure equitable healthcare development and appropriate resource allocation across Uganda's diverse geographic contexts.

### **Sensitivity Analyses and Robustness Checks**

**Missing Data Analysis**  
Multiple imputation analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of findings to missing data assumptions. Using chained equations with 10 imputed datasets, we imputed missing values for BMI (n=10), alcohol use (n=175), and 30-day rehospitalization status (n=49). The imputation model included all variables in the final mortality prediction model plus relevant auxiliary variables.

Results from multiple imputation were highly consistent with complete case analysis. The mortality prediction model C-statistic varied by only 0.006 across imputed datasets (range 0.724-0.736 vs 0.730 for complete cases), confirming that missing data did not substantially bias primary findings. HIV mortality analysis showed similarly consistent results, with odds ratios ranging from 1.18-1.31 across imputed datasets compared to 1.25 in complete case analysis.

The consistency between complete case and multiple imputation approaches provided strong evidence that missing data patterns were missing at random and did not threaten the validity of primary conclusions. The minimal missing data rates for core variables (<5%) supported the appropriateness of complete case analysis as the primary approach.

**Alternative Model Specifications**  
Sensitivity analysis explored alternative modeling approaches to assess the stability of mortality prediction results. Logistic regression models using different variable selection methods (forward selection, best subsets regression) yielded nearly identical final models, with respiratory rate appearing in 100% of alternative specifications and systolic blood pressure in 95%.

Non-linear modeling approaches including generalized additive models and fractional polynomials were explored to assess potential non-linear relationships. These analyses revealed predominantly linear relationships for core predictors, supporting the appropriateness of standard logistic regression. Small improvements in model fit (pseudo R² increase <0.02) did not justify increased model complexity.

Bootstrap analysis of variable selection stability showed that the three-variable final model appeared in 89% of 1000 bootstrap samples, with respiratory rate selected in 99% of samples. This high stability supported confidence in the model structure and generalizability to similar populations.

**Geographic Sensitivity Analysis**  
Hospital-stratified analysis examined whether findings were consistent across study sites. Mortality prediction model performance was similar across hospitals (C-statistics: Mulago 0.72, Kirrudu 0.74, Naguru 0.69), indicating that the model was not dependent on site-specific factors. HIV mortality associations remained non-significant within each hospital stratum.

Exclusion of the hospital with smallest sample size (Naguru, n=29) did not materially change any primary findings, with C-statistics and odds ratios remaining within 0.02 and 0.05 respectively of primary analysis values. This stability suggested that results were not driven by any single site or outlier population.

Urban-rural stratified analysis showed consistent mortality prediction model performance in both geographic settings (urban C-statistic 0.73, rural 0.71), supporting the generalizability of findings across Uganda's geographic contexts represented in the study population.

**Clinical Cutpoint Sensitivity**  
Alternative cutpoints for clinical risk score components were systematically evaluated. Respiratory rate thresholds of 28, 30, and 32 breaths/min yielded C-statistics of 0.669, 0.675, and 0.671 respectively, confirming that 30 breaths/min was optimal. Oxygen saturation cutpoints of 88%, 90%, and 92% yielded C-statistics of 0.672, 0.675, and 0.669, supporting the 90% threshold.

These analyses demonstrated that score performance was robust to small variations in cutpoint selection while confirming that the chosen thresholds were optimal for discrimination. The consistent performance across similar cutpoints supported the clinical appropriateness of the selected values and their alignment with established clinical guidelines.
